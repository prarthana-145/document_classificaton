## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
* Python (3.8+)
* Node.js and npm

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Download the Model File

The trained model file (`best_model.pt`) is not included in this repository due to its size. You need to download it separately and place it in the root directory of the project.

**[‚û°Ô∏è Download the `best_model.pt` file from here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15b7xurcHdTHntdZYc1W0NGFcx0qdcdJm/view?usp=sharing)**

*(Note: You'll need to replace the link above with a public link to your model file, e.g., from Google Drive or Dropbox.)*

### Installation & Setup

The project requires running the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```sh
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name
